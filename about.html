          <p>As broad as the Search Engine Optimization field of activities may be, we’re constantly trying to expand
            our
            expertise
            and add more SEO-related services. Starting with an SEO strategy and SEO copywriting and finishing with an
            SEO
            keywords
            promotion, we’ve got all the process covered, helping you rank higher in Google, Yahoo and Bing!

          </div>
          <p>If there’s anything that is detrimental and unaltered in our whole course of work, those are the KPIs and
            ROI
            metrics.
            All the work we do would be useless not compliant with a quantitive goal, set by the client at the start of
            our works…
            This means that as far as our agency fee for SEO services is concerned, you will be paying us exclusively
            for
            results
            and for results only!

            the
            end results
            that you want us to achieve in mind, we’re always focused on getting there. That means – our fee depends on

            <h3>PPC Campaign
            </h3>
            <p>What a time for web promotion! Initially I’ve requested just a PPC campaign for my new startup, but
              eventually ended up
              with both a Digital Strategy, New Media campaign and ads and the Search Engine Optimization process
              underway.
